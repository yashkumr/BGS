            {" "}
            In compliance with UK and European data protection regulations, this privacy policy explains what personal information we collect from you when you visit our website or are a recipient of our services.
          </p>

          <p>
          BGS Energy (UB) is committed to processing any personal data or information about its staff, contractors, partners, clients and potential clients in ways that comply with its legal and regulatory obligations, and to being clear about what it does with their personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
          This Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy together with our terms of use, provides an explanation as to what happens to any personal data that you provide to us, or that we collect from you.
          </p>
          <p>We do update this Policy from time to time so please do review this Policy regularly.</p>
          <h5>Personal Data Collected</h5>
          <p>
          BGS Energy (UB) are a broker of electricity, gas, water, merchant services and telecoms supply for businesses; mainly targeted at SME market. We provide competitive contract pricing and assist our SME clients in the set up or transfer of BGS Energy supply
          </p>
          <p>
          The data we collect to fulfil these services is almost entirely from business or non-personal individuals and will be processed for business purposes. However, as we target the SME market a high proportion of the data we collect and process will be from Sole Traders or Partnerships so we recognise our commitment to these clients under personal data regulations
          </p>
          <p>The personal information which we use will be taken when:</p>
          <p>
            If the customer agrees to use our services, BGS Energy will use
            its reasonable endeavours to identify, negotiate and secure
            competitive energy prices. Energy prices are obtained from a panel
            of energy suppliers using price books provided by suppliers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The customer agrees to provide BGS Energy with accurate
            information to allow accurate quotations to be obtained – including
            estimated or actual usage of energy, contract end dates and other
            know factors that may influence prices and quotations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The provision of a quotation by a supplier via BGS Energy does
            not constitute an offer to the customer and offers will each have
            their own supplier’s terms and obligations attached.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the customer accepts a quotation and a contract is executed
            between the customer and the supplier, the contract is binding, and
            the customer will not be permitted to revoke such an acceptance.
            There is no cooling off period for business energy contracts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The supplier shall be entitled at any time to refuse to accept a
            customer’s offer of acceptance at their discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the customer and supplier wish to enter into a contract, BGS
            Energy will provide a switching service (or renewal service) which
            will include organising the contract between the customer and the
            energy supplier for the purchase and supply of the energy services.
          </p>

          <h5 className="">Charges</h5>
          <p>
            BGS Energy is remunerated directly by the suppliers and receives
            a commission for securing and finalising the contract between the
            customer and the energy supplier. This is usually by way of an
            uplift that is applied within your unit cost for energy. The cost of
            BGS Energy’s service is therefore included within the unit cost
            of the energy contract that you agree with the supplier.
          </p>
          <p>
            By way of example, we may secure a price for electricity at 25 pence
            per KWH and apply a 1p uplift. The contracted price we would offer
            would therefore be 26 pence. Our commission would be calculated as
            1p multiplied by your annual energy consumption and multiplied by
            the contract term. Our uplifts depend on the size of contract,
            length and other factors such as credit risks. Our average uplift is
            a few percent of your total energy cost and typically around 1p.
            Because we get paid by suppliers, we only offer prices from those
            suppliers on our panel. Our panel currently consists of over 90% of
            the UK business energy suppliers (by customer numbers) so we have a
            very wide range to price from. Further information on how much
            commission we expect to receive on a contract can be found by
            contacting our customer services team.
          </p>
          <h5>Duplicate contract fees</h5>
          <p>
            Where the customer enters into a contract with a supplier and uses
            the BGS Energy service, this contract must be accepted as
            legally binding. In the event the customer enters into another
            contract with another supplier, and the contract facilitated by
            BGS Energy fails to proceed to live status, BGS Energy will
            receive no fee for its services from a supplier and will have
            incurred time and loss.
          </p>

          <p>
            In those circumstances, BGS Energy reserves the right to charge
            the customer a one off “failed contract” fee of £750 per meter, or
            the total value of commission we would have earnt on the contract
            introduction (per meter) – whichever is the higher figure. This is
            in addition to any charges the supplier may also attempt to recover
            for the failed contract. It is important that once you have entered
            into a contract with a supplier that you honour that contract and do
            not enter into duplicate contracts with other suppliers. A “Win
            Back” is where we introduce you back to your incumbent supplier
            (renew) after beating another price from another supplier you have
            agreed to move too. By winning back the contract you are effectively
            cancelling the contract you have agreed to leave your incumbent
            supplier and renew again with them.
          </p>
          <h5 className="">Change of Tenancy Notifications and Fees</h5>
          <p>
            Where a customer enters into an energy contract through BGS Energy
            but decides to move premises mid contract the contract will
            terminate. This is called a “change of tenancy” or “COT”. BGS
            Energys fees are adjusted by supplier if a COT occurs. Its therefore
            important that you notify BGS Energy at least 14 days before the
            end of your energy contract in the event that you are moving
            premises and a COT will occur. Failure to notify BGS Energy will
            incur a fee for the loss / reduction in commission the supplier pays
            us. In those circumstances, BGS Energy reserves the right to
            charge the customer a one off “failed contract” fee of £750 per
            meter plus VAT, or the total value of commission we would have earnt
            on the contract introduction (per meter) – whichever is the higher
            figure. BGS Energy will discount the % of the contract that’s
            been fulfilled from the failed contract fee.
          </p>
          <h5>Failure to go live</h5>
          <p>
            If a contract fails to go live (commence supply) due to the customer
            failing to provide us with information or documentation requested by
            either us or the supplier, or through a failure of a supplier /
            supplier refusing to accept supply, BGS Energy reserves the
            right to charge the customer a one off fee of £750 per meter plus
            VAT. Critical information required, but not limited too includes –
            signed letters of authority, current supplier information, meter
            numbers, contract start or end dates, termination notifications,
            supplier ceasing to trade / onboard contracts, duplicate contracts
            set up with another supplier / broker and banking details including
            setting up direct debits or standing orders with a new supplier.
          </p>
          <h5>Aims of Promotion</h5>
          <p>
            For existing customers of BGS Energy with an annual consumption
            of less than 10,000 for single gas or electricity meters, we are
            offering to pay the BGS Energy fee of £78.50 for any British Gas
            Lite contract completed through our self-serve platform. By using
            our online platform, we are able to process your contract at a lower
            cost, therefore we are able to reduce our contractual fee to £0. All
            submissions through this platform must identify with the customer
            data held, including but not limited to Meter Number, Annual
            Consumption, Decision Maker Name, and Business Name. Only 12-month
            contracts will be offered, if a contract is agreed over this term
            the offer will not be valid. Any offer of a contract is subject to a
            credit check, if the credit rating is not reached or the supplier
            objects to the contract for any reason the offer will not be valid.
            Within 30 days of the agreement being live, the BGS Energy will
            contact the customer to arrange payment. This offer is only valid
            until the 30th of April, all agreements must be received by BGS
            Energy by this time. BGS Energy has the right to withdraw or
            amend the “No-Fee Fix” promotion at any time.
